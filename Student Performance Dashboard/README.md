# Power BI Dashboard for Student Performance Analytics

ðŸš€ **Power BI Dashboard for Student Performance Analytics!** ðŸ“ŠðŸ“ˆ

I recently had the opportunity to create an interactive Power BI dashboard for a USA-based client on Fiverr. This dashboard provides valuable insights into student academic and extracurricular performance, helping institutions make data-driven decisions.

## ðŸ”¹ Features:
- âœ… **Login Page** â€“ Secure access for students and staff.
- âœ… **Student Performance Page** â€“ Individual student reports, behavior scores, attendance tracking, and subject-wise analysis.
- âœ… **Overall Student Performance for Staff** â€“ Comprehensive insights on total students, gender distribution, extracurricular participation, disciplinary records, and subject-wise performance.

With this dashboard, schools can efficiently monitor student progress, identify areas for improvement, and enhance educational outcomes.

ðŸ’¡ This project highlights the power of data visualization in the education sector, making student performance tracking more effective and insightful.

## ðŸ’¡ Key Technologies Used:
- Power BI
- Data Analysis
- Dashboards & Reporting
- Excel (for data input)
  
Would love to hear your thoughts! What other features would you add to improve student performance tracking?
